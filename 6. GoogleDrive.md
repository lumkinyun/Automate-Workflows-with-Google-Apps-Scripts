```js
function createFoldersInDrive() {
  const parentFolderId = "YOUR_PARENT_FOLDER_ID"; // Replace with your parent folder's ID
  const folderNames = ["Project Alpha", "Project Beta", "Project Gamma"];
  
  try {
    const parentFolder = DriveApp.getFolderById(parentFolderId);
    
    folderNames.forEach(folderName => {
      parentFolder.createFolder(folderName);
      Logger.log(`Folder "${folderName}" created successfully.`);
    });
    
  } catch (e) {
    Logger.log(`Error: ${e.toString()}`);
  }
}
```
</details>

### How to Use the Script:

1.  **Find the Parent Folder ID:**
    *   Open Google Drive and navigate to the folder where you want to create the new folders.
    *   The ID is the last part of the URL in your browser's address bar. For example, if the URL is `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12345abcdefg`, your folder ID is `12345abcdefg`.

2.  **Open Google Apps Script:**
    *   Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com).
    *   Create a new project.

3.  **Paste and Modify the Code:**
    *   Copy the code above into the script editor.
    *   Replace `"YOUR_PARENT_FOLDER_ID"` with the actual ID of your parent folder.
    *   You can change the `folderNames` array to include the names of the folders you want to create.

4.  **Run the Script:**
    *   Save the project.
    *   Click the "Run" button (▶️) to execute the `createFoldersInDrive` function.

5.  **Authorize the Script:**
    *   The first time you run the script, you'll be asked to grant it permission to access your Google Drive. Follow the prompts to authorize it.

6.  **Check Your Google Drive:**
    *   Once the script finishes, go to your parent folder in Google Drive. You should see the new folders you listed in the `folderNames` array.
